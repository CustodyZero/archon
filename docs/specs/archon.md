# Archon

## What This Is

Archon is a deterministic coordination kernel that enforces operator-defined authority boundaries for local AI agents and human–AI workflows.

It is an execution gate, not a reasoning system.

---

## Scope

Archon exists to:

- Coordinate local AI agents under explicit authority constraints
- Eliminate emergent execution entropy in multi-agent systems
- Preserve human authority in hybrid workflows
- Replace narrative-based orchestration with deterministic enforcement

Archon does not:

- Perform reasoning or simulation
- Infer policy
- Expand its own authority
- Act autonomously outside operator-defined bounds

---

## Core Model

Every proposed agent action must satisfy:

1. Capability containment  
2. Dynamic restriction compliance  
3. Deterministic validation against a hashed rule snapshot  

If any condition fails, execution is denied or escalated.

---

## Structural Principles

- No implicit permissions
- No silent capability expansion
- Deny overrides allow
- Operator confirmation on change
- All decisions are replayable

---

## Design Position

Archon is local-first.

It is designed for technical operators who require:

- Explicit module enablement
- Inspectable rule composition
- Deterministic enforcement
- Elimination of orchestration drift

Archon gates execution.

It does not decide policy.
